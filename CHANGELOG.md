# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Privacy manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) declaring UserDefaults (CA92.1) and file-timestamp (3B52.1) Required Reason API usage, plus no-tracking / no-data-collection declarations for Mac App Store submission.
- `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` in Info.plist to clear App Store export-compliance for each upload.
- Built-in clipboard exclusions for common password managers so sensitive clipboard sources are skipped even before a custom blacklist is enabled.

### Fixed
- Resources (`Assets.xcassets`, privacy manifest) were not bundled because `project.yml` used an invalid `resources:` target key; moved them under `sources:` so the app icon and privacy manifest are now compiled into the build.
- **App Store rejection (Guideline 2.4.5):** removed all use of macOS Accessibility features. The optional shake-to-show-shelf gesture only ever observed mouse-drag events (`NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` for `.leftMouseDragged` / `.leftMouseUp`), which per AppKit documentation do **not** require Accessibility permission. The app no longer calls `AXIsProcessTrusted`, no longer requests Accessibility permission, and the permission prompt/onboarding (`PermissionChecker`, `PermissionGuideView`, `PermissionGuideWindow`) has been removed. This also restores the shake gesture for users who had not granted the (unnecessary) permission.

### Changed
- Bumped build number (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`) to `1.0.7` for App Store resubmission.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- Reworked watched-folder access to use sandbox-compatible bookmarks for Mac App Store submission.
- Removed the in-app GitHub update path and updated release/distribution documentation for App Store distribution.
- Added submission notes, privacy draft content, and stronger test coverage for folder bookmark persistence.
- Decoupled shelf grid/list cells from the view model and lazy-load thumbnails on cell appearance to reduce SwiftUI re-renders during selection changes.
- Sized shelf thumbnails by display mode (200×200 for grid/collapsed/drag, 64×64 for list) to avoid oversized image decoding.

### Fixed
- Added a generation token to FolderMonitor so stale delayed checks after stop/start cannot mis-report files from a previous folder.
- ThumbnailCache now drops its contents on system memory pressure (warning/critical) instead of only relying on NSCache's internal limits.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Eliminated disk writes during thumbnail generation to avoid feedback loops in watched folders.
- Improved sandbox readiness for folder monitoring and App Store distribution.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Reduced repeated object creation and unnecessary I/O in clipboard handling.
- Prevented `ThumbnailCache` from creating an infinite loop when the watched folder changed.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Fixed the search field so Chinese IME space-selection no longer triggers preview unexpectedly.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- Refined the settings layout for a clearer preferences experience.

### Added
- Added update-checker infrastructure and simplified HTML clipboard conversion.
